# Bitcoin-Price-Trend-Time-Series-Analysis
Objective: The project aimed to predict Bitcoin prices using three models—Prophet, SARIMAX, and LSTM—by analyzing historical price and volume data.

Best Model: The LSTM model outperformed the others with the lowest RMSE (6,988.08), showing its ability to capture complex patterns in time-series data.

Data Preprocessing: Key steps included handling missing values, normalizing the data for LSTM, and incorporating volume as an additional feature for Prophet and SARIMAX models.

Model Evaluation: The models were evaluated using RMSE, with Prophet (34,248.69) and SARIMAX (35,276.66) showing higher errors compared to LSTM, which indicated better predictive accuracy.

Insights: Bitcoin price forecasting is complex due to volatility, but using advanced models like LSTM, along with features such as volume and moving averages, provides valuable insights into price movements.
